    <p>Hard working, creative, confident, honest, and leader are just some of the qualties I would use to describe myself.  A father to a five year old boy, who emcompasses all my better qualities.  A daily goal of mine is set a strong and positive example for him. </p>

    <p> Some of my interests include technology, sports, and current events. I have aspirations to build a technological corporation someday.  I enjoy learning about the ins and out of business and try to incorporate these skills in my daily life.</p>
